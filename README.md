# The Journalino
This is the repo of the little "theJournalino" bot that unfortunately cannot 
be verified by discord because of "trust and safety" concerns bounded to the articles 
being scraped from google and sent straight to the server.
This means that (hypothetically speaking) the bot could send gore/porn images into the server
without being able to check it.

This is just my assumption as discord, for obvious "safety reasons", cannot share the real reason with me.

For the reason above, TheJournalino is doomed to never be able to join more than 100 guilds (servers).

I'll keep the bot up and running for as long as I can.

Thanks for your understanding. <3
