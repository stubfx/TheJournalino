                Hello there! I'm here to share some information on the Discord bot "TheJournalino". This bot is designed
                to help you stay informed and up-to-date on the latest news, as well as provide a way for you to give
                suggestions on how to improve the bot. Here's how it works: multiple times during the day, it will send
                news in the channel that you have chosen, with the topic and language of your choice. Here's how you can
                use it:
                <br><br>
                Adding News to Your Channel: If you want to keep up with the latest news, simply use the command "/news
                add". The bot will then add a news job to the current channel, so you and your friends can stay
                informed.
                <br><br>
                Promote Your Server: If you want to promote your server to anybody else's news channels you just need to
                use the "/promo" command. This will automatically create an invite for the channel you used the command in
                that will work as long as you are receiving news in any other channel (must be visible to @everyone)! Cheers!
                <br><br>
                Removing News: If you're not interested in a specific news topic, use the command "/news remove". The
                bot will then remove that topic from the channel.
                <br><br>
                Making Suggestions: If you have any ideas on how to improve TheJournalino, you can use the command
                "/suggestion". This will allow you to share your thoughts and suggestions.
                <br><br>
                Getting Help: If you need assistance or are having trouble with the bot, use the command "/help". This
                will redirect you to the help page you need.
                <br><br>
                That's all there is to it! With these commands, you can easily use TheJournalino to stay informed and
                provide feedback. Have fun!
            </p>
