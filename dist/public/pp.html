            <h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
            <p class="text-white text-start" style="max-width: 800px;">
                This Privacy Policy describes how TheJournalino (the "Bot", "we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and shares information about you when you use the Bot. By using the Bot, you consent to the processing of your information as set forth in this Privacy Policy.
                <br>
                Information We Collect
                We collect information you provide to us, such as your Discord user ID and any information you provide in connection with your use of the Bot.
                <br>
                We may also automatically collect certain information about your use of the Bot, including your Discord username, the date and time of your access, and the device and software you are using to access the Bot.
                <br>
                Use of Information
                We use the information we collect to provide, maintain, and improve the Bot, to communicate with you, and to personalize your experience with the Bot.
                <br>
                We may also use the information we collect for analytics and research purposes.
                <br>
                Sharing of Information
                We may share your information with our service providers who assist us in providing, maintaining, and improving the Bot.
                <br>
                We may also share your information if we believe such sharing is necessary to comply with legal process or to protect our rights, property, or safety.

                Your Choices
                You may decline to provide us with your information, but this may limit your ability to use the Bot.

                Data Security
                We take reasonable measures to protect the information we collect from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
                <br>

If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you by email or by posting a notice on the Bot prior to the effective date of the changes. By continuing to use the Bot after the effective date of any such changes, you agree to be bound by the revised Privacy Policy.
